# 🌍 Sys::Monitor::Lite — Vision

## Overview

`Sys::Monitor::Lite` is a lightweight system monitoring module that outputs JSON.
Its purpose is not merely to build another handy tool, but to **promote the democratization of IT infrastructure and the distributed evolution of observability**.

This project aims to deliver "lightweight, open, and human- and machine-readable monitoring" to every environment across the globe.

## 🌍 1. Meeting the Global Demand for Lightweight Monitoring

Many monitoring systems (Prometheus, Datadog, etc.) are powerful,
but they are **overkill** for the small to medium environments that make up the vast majority of the world.

For example:

* Small-scale cloud or on-prem environments
* Educational institutions, municipalities, research labs, individual developers
* IoT nodes and home Linux servers

These environments face challenges such as:

* Lacking the resources to run heavy monitoring stacks
* Still needing standardized monitoring for CPU / memory / disks
* Requiring simplicity that can be handled with cron or shell scripts

`Sys::Monitor::Lite` provides these teams with a **lightweight observability layer**.

---

## 💾 2. Creating a Common Language with JSON

Monitoring and telemetry platforms worldwide now use **JSON** as their common language.

* OpenTelemetry
* CloudWatch / Azure Monitor / Datadog APIs
* Data processing with jq / jq-lite / Python / Node.js

By adopting **JSON as the native output format**, `Sys::Monitor::Lite` can:

* Pipe directly into Fluent Bit or Logstash
* Be easily analyzed by AI / LLMs
* Complete the "monitor → analyze → notify" loop in one line when combined with jq-lite

This bridges a simple, Perl-centric monitoring ecosystem with other languages.

---

## 🐪 3. Paving the Way for a Perl Renaissance

Perl is known as an "old but mighty" language,
and it still excels at building lightweight tools.

Together, `Sys::Monitor::Lite` and `jq-lite`:

* Keep dependencies minimal and portability high
* Run both as CLIs and modules
* Embrace a modern, JSON-first design

This gives Perl a new chance to be recognized as a **lightweight systems utility language**.
Its affinity for Linux environments—directly handling `/proc`, for example—is a strength unmatched by other languages.

---

## 🌐 4. Advancing Open Observability

Modern monitoring is increasingly cloud-dependent and vendor-locked.
`Sys::Monitor::Lite` offers a **free alternative** to that closed culture of observability.

* OSS without vendor lock-in
* Operates in offline or air-gapped environments
* Makes it easy to reuse and share data through JSON

Spreading **Observability Freedom** around the world is the mission of this project.

---

## ⚡ 5. Preparing for the Infrastructure-as-Text Era

We are moving beyond IaC (Infrastructure as Code) toward an era of **Infrastructure as Text / Telemetry as JSON**.

Storing and analyzing monitoring data and configurations as "text" enables:

* Tracking history with Git
* Automated analysis via ChatGPT / LLMs
* Converting data into human- and machine-friendly formats with jq-lite

`Sys::Monitor::Lite` functions as part of an **AIOps foundation for the age of AI-driven operations automation**.

---

## 🚀 6. Evolution Through Open Modules

With `jq-lite` and `Sys::Monitor::Lite` together,
Perl gains, for the first time, a complete flow of "observe → filter → decide → notify".

```bash
Sys::Monitor::Lite  →  JSON output
      ↓
jq-lite              →  Conditional extraction / processing
      ↓
CLI / Bot / Script   →  Notification / logging
```

This setup makes it possible to build "monitoring stacks that run entirely on Perl"
in small clouds, DIY Kubernetes clusters, research environments, IoT deployments, and beyond around the world.

## ✨ Summary of Global Impact

| Perspective | Impact |
| ----------- | ------ |
| 🌍 Social    | Provides lightweight, open monitoring to every environment |
| 💾 Technical | Standardizes observability data with JSON and bridges to other languages |
| 🐪 Perl      | Revitalizes Perl through modern utilities and renewed recognition |
| ⚙️ Operational | Promotes "open observability" without cloud dependency |
| 🤖 Future    | Builds a foundation for AI/LLM-driven automation and autonomous operations |

---

## 📝 Conclusion

`Sys::Monitor::Lite` is more than just a module.
It embodies the philosophy of "opening observability data to everyone."

We hope this project helps spread a **small yet dependable culture of free monitoring** throughout the world.
